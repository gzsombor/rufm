* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [General](#general)


Widgets:

* [Files](#files)
* [Favourites](#favourites)
* [Search](#search)
* [Preview](#preview)

### Urgent

Nothing urgent at the moment!

### Configuration

- [x] Remove the startup information.
- [ ] Add custom shortcuts.
    - E.q. ch -> executes cd ~ ...
    - Should be defined in a new section.

### General

- [ ] Add long shortcuts.
    - E.q. cc instead of C for copying ...
    - Could be achieved with saving the key if no action was found. 
    - After that append the key to the new input and check again.
    - Allows more shortcuts and simple combinations to remember.


### Files 

- [ ] Different colors for directories and files.
    - Should be configurable.
- [ ] Rename multiple files with a text editor.
- [ ] Select/deselect all files in a directory.

### Favourites

Nothing right now.

### Search

- [ ] Add a keyboard shortcut to clear the search.

### Preview

- [ ] Syntax highlighting.
    - Very low priority because it's pretty hard.
        - Tui-rs does not render ansi color codes.
- [ ] Directory preview.
    - Acts like a file list in the selected directory.
